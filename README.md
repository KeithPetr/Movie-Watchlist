# Movie-Watchlist
## A Scrimba FrontEnd Developer Path Project
The project uses the OMDb API to create a search page the returns a list of movies from the terms you enter in the search bar. From the results, the user can read a description of the movie and click on a button to save that movie to their watchlist. The data is stored in local storage so that the user can return later and view the saved movies.

## Project Requirements
This project required me to follow a Figma design
and build the layout using CSS and HTML from scratch.
I was required to use JavaScript functions, arrays, loops
and the API to create the functionality.

## This project includes the following 'stretch goals':
  - prevent duplicate movies from rendering
  - Storing the data in the browser
  - Accessing the data to indicate movies already saved
